FINANCIAL MODELING
- ðŸ”­ I have created models for:
          - Time Value of Money Exercises: PV / FV
          - NPV / IRR Calculations
          - Loan Amortization Scenario Analysis

MACHINE LEARNING
- ðŸ”­ I completed a desktop application that allows you to import dataframes, manipulate them, and build models. The models are linear regressions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading "Machine Learning with PyTorch and SciKit-Learn" by Sebastian Raschka, Yuxi Li, and Vahid Mirjalili.
